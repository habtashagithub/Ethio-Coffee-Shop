          <h3>What makes our Coffee Special</h3>
          <p>
            Each cup of Ethiopian coffee tells a story through its distinct
            flavor. Our beans are known for their bright acidity, floral notes,
            and hints of fruit such as blueberries, jasmine, or citrus. These
            unique profiles are a result of Ethiopiaâ€™s diverse growing regions,
            which impart their own characteristics to the beans, making each cup
            a journey for the senses.
